### Upload Flow
1. User drags/drops image or clicks to browse
2. File validation (size, type)
3. Shows loading spinner
4. POSTs to `/api/upload/image` via FormData

6. Returns public URL
7. Auto-fills the text input field
8. Shows preview with success message

### CSS Styling
- Hover effects on upload areas
- Smooth transitions
- Purple accent color (#7c3aed) matching admin theme
- Responsive image previews

## Usage Instructions

### For Admin Users:
1. **Login to admin panel**: https://6a77b5b9.webapp-ds7.pages.dev/admin
2. **Go to "All Agents"** and click edit on any agent
3. **Navigate to "Media & Links" tab**
4. **Upload Logo**:
   - Drag & drop an image onto the logo upload area, OR
   - Click the upload area to browse files, OR
   - Paste a URL/emoji in the text field below
5. **Upload Cover Image**:

## Deployment

### Latest Deployment
- **URL**: https://6a77b5b9.webapp-ds7.pages.dev/
- **Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Status**: ✅ Live and functional

### Test Credentials
- **Admin**: admin@aiagents.directory / admin123
- **User**: user@example.com / user123

## What This Fixes

Previously, the admin edit form only had text input fields for "Logo URL or Emoji" and "Cover Image URL". This meant admins had to:
- Upload images elsewhere first
- Copy the URL
- Paste it into the form

Now admins can:
- **Upload directly** from the edit form
- **Drag & drop** images for faster workflow
- **See previews** immediately after upload
- **Still use URLs/emojis** if preferred (text inputs remain)

## Comparison: Public Submit Form vs Admin Edit Form

Both now have **identical upload functionality**:
- ✅ Drag & drop upload areas
- ✅ Real-time upload progress
- ✅ Image previews
- ✅ R2 storage integration
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ File size validation

## Next Steps (Optional)

Future enhancements could include:
1. Image cropping/editing before upload
2. Multiple logo versions (favicon, thumbnail, full-size)
3. Image optimization (auto-resize, compression)
4. Batch upload for multiple agents
5. Gallery view of uploaded images
