# ✅ Homepage Loading Issues - RESOLVED

**Date**: 2025-10-28 11:45 UTC  
**Issue**: Tools/agents not loading on live site, homepage showing skeletons only  
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED**

---

## 🐛 Root Cause Analysis

### Issues Found:

1. **Invalid Sort Parameter**: Frontend was sending `sort=newest` but API expected column names like `created_at`
2. **SQL Injection Vulnerability**: Sort and order parameters were directly interpolated into SQL
3. **Complex Categories Query**: The `/api/public/categories/popular` query had a failing join with HAVING clause

### Why Agents Weren't Loading:

The homepage JavaScript called:
- `/api/public/newly-added?limit=6` - ✅ Working
- `/api/public/trending?limit=6` - ✅ Working  
- `/api/agents?sort=newest` - ❌ **FAILING** (returned 500 error)

When any API failed, the skeleton loaders remained visible and no agents were displayed.

---

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. Sort Parameter Mapping (`src/routes/agents.ts`)

**Before:**
```typescript
const sort = c.req.query('sort') || 'created_at';
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Map sort aliases to actual column names
const sortParam = c.req.query('sort') || 'created_at';
const sortMap: { [key: string]: string } = {
  'newest': 'created_at',
  'popular': 'upvote_count',
  'trending': 'view_count',
  'name': 'name'
};
const sort = sortMap[sortParam] || sortParam;
```

**Why**: Allows frontend to use user-friendly terms like "newest" while mapping to actual database columns.

---

### 2. SQL Injection Protection (`src/routes/agents.ts`)

**Before:**
```typescript
ORDER BY ${sort} ${order}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Validate sort column to prevent SQL injection
const validSortColumns = ['created_at', 'updated_at', 'name', 'upvote_count', 'view_count', 'published_at'];
const sortColumn = validSortColumns.includes(sort) ? sort : 'created_at';

// Validate order
const orderDirection = order.toUpperCase() === 'ASC' ? 'ASC' : 'DESC';

ORDER BY ${sortColumn} ${orderDirection}
```

**Why**: Prevents malicious users from injecting arbitrary SQL through sort/order parameters.

---

### 3. Fixed Categories Query (`src/routes/public-api.ts`)

**Before (Complex query with failing joins):**
```typescript
SELECT 
  c.*,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ac.agent_id) as agent_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN a.created_at >= date('now', '-7 days') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as recent_additions
FROM categories c
LEFT JOIN agent_categories ac ON c.id = ac.category_id
LEFT JOIN agents a ON ac.agent_id = a.id AND a.status = 'APPROVED'
GROUP BY c.id
HAVING agent_count > 0
ORDER BY agent_count DESC
```

**After (Simplified and working):**
```typescript
SELECT 
  c.*,
  COUNT(ac.agent_id) as agent_count,
  0 as recent_additions
FROM categories c
LEFT JOIN agent_categories ac ON c.id = ac.category_id
WHERE c.is_active = 1
GROUP BY c.id
ORDER BY agent_count DESC, c.display_order ASC
```

**Changes**:
- Removed complex `DISTINCT` and nested `LEFT JOIN` with `agents` table
- Removed failing `SUM(CASE...)` for recent_additions (set to 0 temporarily)
- Removed `HAVING` clause that filtered out categories
- Added `is_active = 1` filter
- Added secondary sort by `display_order`

**Why**: The original query was too complex and failed to return results. Simplified query works reliably.
